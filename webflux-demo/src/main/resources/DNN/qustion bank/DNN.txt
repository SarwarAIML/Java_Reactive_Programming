Question 1. 
Given a truth table, design a perceptron and find the weights and threshold of the perceptron
X1       	X2         Y
0          	0          1
1           0          0
0          	1          0
1           1          0



Question 2.

Construct an MLP for the given boolean expression. What is the depth and width of the MLP? 

A    B    C    D     Y
1    0    1    0     1
1    1    1    0     1
1    0    0    1     1
1    0    1    1     1
1    0    0    0     1

Question 3. 
Find the number of layers and number of perceptrons required for an MLP that can be used for computing the XOR of 6 parameters. Draw the MLP network. If a single hidden layer is used, how many perceptions will be required?

Question 4. 
Derive the equation for the derivative of binary cross entropy loss L with respect to the weight assuming activation  a = σ (Z) and the loss L is computed from this activation A.


Question 5. 
Draw the computational graph for the equation f = relu(ax+by+c). Show the computation of derivatives of f wrt a, b, c in the graph. Using the graph, compute the value of f and  derivatives if a = 3, b=2, c= (-5),  z = 2 and y = 3.

Question 6.                                                                                                                                                                 
Given an error surface,
E(p,q,r)=3p²+3g²+4r+5
compute the optimal value of learning rate that will minimize the error surface, the largest learning rate for convergence and smallest learning rate for divergence.
